# Polish DVB-T2 Tables
[ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Polska wersja](README.pl.md)  

This project's goal is to download and compile DVB-T2 transmitters data from [Emitel](https://emitel.pl/), a polish tv operator.  
It makes it possible to easily watch digital television using [Kaffeine](https://apps.kde.org/pl/kaffeine/) and [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), as well as simplifying manual setup by providing a full frequency table.

# How to use
For usage instructions see [Emitel-Tables](https://github.com/Defective4/Emitel-Tables/blob/master/INSTALL.md) repository.
